Tech challenge

Here lies my crack at the full stack technical challenge, as provided by CDL.

Steps for viewing locally: 
- In a terminal CD into the server folder.
- Run "npm install".
- Once complete, run "npm run dev", starting up the server with nodemon.
- Port should automatically connect to localhost:3000.
- Open second terminal, and CD into the client.
- Run "npm install"
- Run "npm run serve" to open the client in a browser.
- Enjoy
